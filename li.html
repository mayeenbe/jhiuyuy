<h2>food</h2>
<p>
    Food is any substance consumed by an organism to
     provide nutritional support and energy. Food can be of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and minerals. Food is used by the body to sustain growth, repair, and vital processes. Food is facilitated by digestion, 
    which breaks down the food into smaller components that can be
     absorbed and utilized by the body.
